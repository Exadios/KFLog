This directory is used for the airspace files.

KFLog supports two airspace source formats:

1. OpenAir files with the extension [txt|TXT].

2. openAIP from http://www.openaip.net/ with the file name
   <2-letter-country-code>_asp.aip
   
   See there for more information.
   
KFLog downloads openAIP airspace files automatically for you in the settings
airspace page. Please define on that page, for which coutries do you want to
download openAIP airspace files and for which countries airspace data should be loaded.
OpenAir files must be installed manually in this directory.

Please do not mix OpenAir and openAIP airspace files from the same country. The
results are unpredictable.
