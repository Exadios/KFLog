Next Steps
==========

* Planning:

  The handling doesn't seem to be intuitive. The task-definition-dialog should
  appear in the dataview as soon as planning begins. That would be the easiest
  way to combine both visual planning and waypoint-selecting.

  We should printout a list of all waypoints and airfields along a planned task.
  When printing a task-map, the borders for the area-based-task is hardly visible
  and not yet configurable. We do not have a task-type "area-based" yet, so the
  text is always wrong.


* Documentation:

  We often talked about this topic, but we don't have a usable documentation yet.


* Mapdisplay:

  When displaying several flights at the same time, we should use different
  colours for the tracks. When the user loads the second flight, a dialog could
  appear, asking if he wants to create a new flight-group.

  Right now, only one flight or flight-group can be displayed at the same time.
  It's a bit difficult to switch on or off a flight, because, the map will allways
  be redrawn after that. There should be an easier handling for that.

  We cannot configure the colour of the elevation-lines or configure, which
  lines should be drawn. We too need a sort of map-legend.


* Evaluation:

  We already can display the upwinds in the the map. It would be nice to have these
  things in the evaluation-dialog, too. And a list of each upwind, with some
  statistical data, would also be nice (including the possibility to center and zoom
  the map to each upwind by selecting it).

  The printout of the flight-data is a bit short, perhaps we can add some more
  things here. We should also printout the data for a flight group.


* OLC-declaration:

  Finishing the online-declaration for the OLC.


* 3D-View:

  The dialog should use the same colour for the track as the 2D-view. It would be
  nice to have some buttons in the dialog for rotating and zooming. Is it possible
  to animate the track in the 3D-view?


Allways a Topic
===============

* integrating of other flightrecorders


Nice To Have
============



Planning
========

* Area-based planning

* graphical planning

  -> printing of planned task (track, not info)

  -> area computation for FAI triangles

* Rules (sectors, radius, possible tasks)
  must be solved in a unspecified way
  necessary for dialoge planning ?

* XML format definition for WayPoint and
  task files used by KFLog

* Import and Export of WayPoints and Tasks

  -> WGS-Import

  -> Others

* List of Sites (Frequencies) and obstacles along the task

* Time Planing (with given average vario and
  polare of the glider)

  -> Import of PC_MET Database


Evaluation
==========

* Display Airspace violations

* online declaration for OLC and DMST-Online

* Thermical Information (list of all upwinds)

* display & print more statistics

* elevation profile (under the Barogram)

* Different colours for flights

* Instrument images for the current flight values
  (Speed, elevation, vario)

* computation of the wind, and display in statistics

* Display ENL (engine noise level)

* Online-declaration to OLC


Map
===

* Customise colours for elevation data

* Shading of elevation data

* Use different colors for the flighttrack, if
  displaying more than one flight.


3D View
=======

* 3digc

  -> same colours for the flight as in 2d map

  -> use mouse for rotate and zoom

  -> animation?

* OpenGl_igc

  -> integration into KFlog


Animation
=========

* several flights at the same time

* option for synchronise the starttime
  for several flights

* animate not only the cursor

  -> additional possibility to draw the flight
     step by step

* center the actual point when it runs out of
  the view


Documentation
=============

* Online Documentation for KDE

* Handbook as PDF or ghostscript for Printing

* System doc


Other
=====

* Flightgear

  -> animate flights in FlightGear

  -> display Airspace in Flightgear

* Remote/command-line drawing of map
  (draw a given flight with the underlying map
  into an image file without open a GUI)

* Chooseable units for KFLog

* Preview

  -> add the duration

  -> display as standard in the flight open dialog

* Link IGC-Files to KFLog (KDE)

* Import IGC-Files

  -> due to the FAI Definition

  -> other Data (eg. ENL)

* Select active Flight
