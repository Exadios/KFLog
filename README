Known bugs
==========

- evaluation window opens with the wrong size

- segfault when editing a waypoint, probably in
  void Waypoints::slotEditWaypoint(Waypoint* w)

- close kflog in evaluation/waypoint mode. open kflog. load flight.
  -> lots of mapfiles are downloaded. Why?

- if the font size in KDE is too large, the numbers in the status
  bar are truncated (e.g. the speed). Maybe we can give those boxes
  a variable size?

not really bugs
===============

- configure needs to check for OpenGL and if it's not available, we
  either need to complain or we need to disable the GL-3D-view.

- not a bug: draw airfields with correct runway orientation.

- show engine noise in evaluation window


Things that disappeared while we got rid of KDE
===============================================

- tip of the day

- option to change waypoint when a waypoint with the same name as an
  existing waypoint is created. Right now we only offer "overwrite"
  and "cancel", not "change name".

- Cumulus flight recorder plugin -- this thing wouldn't work with
  the current Cumulus versions anyhow.

- automatic map download disabled, waiting for Qt4 classes (see downloadlist.cpp
  and mapcontents.cpp)
  
- dockwidgets are standard turned off in the mainwindow, because the layout is
  ugly. Hopefully it is solvable in Qt4. In the meantim they can be made visible
  by selecting them in the Settings menu.
  
- The positions of the dockwidgets and toolbar are not stored when KFLog quits.

- KAbout has been removed. The contents is still available in main.cpp.
  Qt doesn't have an about class, so this has to be written by ourselfs.

- The shortcuts and toolbar cannot be edited anymore, because Qt lacks the
  widgets that KDE had.

- In some messageboxes there was a checkbox to disable the same message in the
  future. Also, some messageboxes of recorderdialog contained a small screen with
  detailed information about an error. QMessageBox doesn't support this and
  therefore it has been removed.
