Current state
=============

- KFLog is ported now fully to Qt4 without using any Qt3 support library parts.
  Not all parts are tested in detail. Some parts can be unstable.

Known bugs
==========

- if the font size in KDE is too large, the numbers in the status
  bar are truncated (e.g. the speed). Maybe we can give those boxes
  a variable size?

not really bugs
===============

- configure needs to check for OpenGL and if it's not available, we
  either need to complain or we need to disable the GL-3D-view.

- show engine noise in evaluation window


Things that disappeared while we got rid of KDE
===============================================

- tip of the day

- option to change waypoint when a waypoint with the same name as an
  existing waypoint is created. Right now we only offer "overwrite"
  and "cancel", not "change name".

- Cumulus flight recorder plugin -- this thing wouldn't work with
  the current Cumulus versions anyhow.
  
- dockwidgets are standard turned off in the mainwindow, because the layout is
  ugly. Hopefully it is solvable in Qt4. In the meantim they can be made visible
  by selecting them in the Settings menu.
  
- The shortcuts and toolbar cannot be edited anymore, because Qt lacks the
  widgets that KDE had.

- In some messageboxes there was a checkbox to disable the same message in the
  future. Also, some messageboxes of recorderdialog contained a small screen with
  detailed information about an error. QMessageBox doesn't support this and
  therefore it has been removed.
