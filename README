Known bugs
==========

- evaluation window opens with the wrong size

- segfault when editing a waypoint, probably in
  void Waypoints::slotEditWaypoint(Waypoint* w)

- close kflog in evaluation/waypoint mode. open kflog. load flight.
  -> lots of mapfiles are downloaded. Why?

- if the font size in KDE is too large, the numbers in the status
  bar are truncated (e.g. the speed). Maybe we can give those boxes
  a variable size?

not really bugs
===============

- configure needs to check for OpenGL and if it's not available, we
  either need to complain or we need to disable the GL-3D-view.

- not a bug: draw airfields with correct runway orientation.

- show engine noise in evaluation window
