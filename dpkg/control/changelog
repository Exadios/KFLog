kflog (4.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also can be handled
    runway length values using unit feet. That is not conform to the SeeYou
    specification but I saw that in a south African SeeYou waypoint file.
    
  * Map item Highway renamed to Motorway according to OSM usage.

  * Export routine added to write SeeYou waypoint files with extension .cup.

kflog (4.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New menu item added to map menu for asking of airspaces.
  
  * City labels are drawn now at the map till scale level less than 100. I saw
    at a first look that not all city labels are the right ones. The issue
    lays in the map data.

  * Bugfix: The coordinates of the map cursor were only displayed in the main
    window's statusbar, if a flight was loaded. That annoyed me. I fixed that.

  * Bugfix: If you touch a drawn flight line with the mouse, the data of the
    touched flight point is displayed in the lower statusbar of the main window.
    But the displayed coordinates were wrong. The latitude and longitude values
    were skewed.
    
  * If the begin or end cursor is moved in the evaluation window, the related
    flight point is now displayed with all its data in the main window's
    statusbar. I want to get the coordinates for a certain position in the
    barogram of the evaluation window but without my patch it was not possible.

kflog (4.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Two new spin boxes added to evaluation view for scaling of speed and
    variometer display by hand or automatically.

  * Drawing scale of evaluation data dynamically adapted to used smooth
    values. That ensures that all available place is used for the drawing.

  * Minimum scale for zooming in changed from 10 to 5.
  
  * Bugfix: Spelling bug fixed in configuration items /Scale/LowerLimit and
    /Scale/UpperLimit.
  
  * Bugfix: Maximum scale value for zoom out via mouse wheel was to large.
    That caused senseless map loading of the whole world.
    
  * IGC file name added to window title of evaluation view and to flight data
    window content.
