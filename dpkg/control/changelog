kflog (__VERSION__) unstable; urgency=low

  * USB problems fixed
  
  * New method added to the WaypointCatalog class, which can read in waypoint
    data from a Welt2000 file. The amount of waypoints must be limited by
    country identifiers because the whole file contains over 57282 entries.
    
  * Airspace file management added to kflog settings.
  
  * Different minor bug fixes.
