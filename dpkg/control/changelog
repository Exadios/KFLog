kflog (4.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Default map projection changed from Lambert to Cylinder projection.
  
  * If the home latitude is set or modified by the user and the cylinder map
    projection is active, the cylinder map projection standard parallel is set
    automatically to the home latitude value to ensure the best map projection.
    For the lambert map projection this is not realized due to more effort.

kflog (4.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Flight recorder data added to flight's objecttree.

  * Bugfix: Endless loop fixed in Welt2000 update procedure.
  
  * Waypoint class modified. All runway attributes are put into a Runway class 
    object and the single Runway objects into a runway list. Now a waypoint
    can have several runways.
    
  * Default constructor added to Waypoint class.
  
  * Default constructor added to Runway class.
    
  * WaypointCatalog class, methods read/write binary adapted to latest Cumulus
    release 5.5.2.

  * Bugfix: Waypoint file selection dialog did not contain *.da4 filter entry for
    all items.
    
  * Bugfix: Airspace violations must be calculated with the barometical altitude
    and not with the GPS altitude. Airspace contacts limited to violations, all
    other can become too much. Altitude info added to begin and end of airspace
    violation. Airspaces must not be loaded again, reuse already loaded airspaces
    from MapContent.
    
  * Airspace contact check execution time crucial reduced by using QPainterPath
    class. Airspace contacts are stored only once as list in the Flight object
    and not more in every FlightPoint object.

  * Build with Linux Ubuntu 13.04 and Qt4.8.4
  
  * Build with Linux Debian 7.1 and Qt4.8.2

kflog (4.7.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * added airspace checking (partly backport from Cumulus) by Matthias Degenkolb
  
  * airspaces shown in browser window
  
  * added airspace data view
  
  * Still open: QNH is currently hard-coded to 1013 hPa, therefore airspace
    checking is not fully precise...

kflog (4.6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with Ubuntu 12.10 and Qt4.8.3

  * Additional checks added in OpenAir parser to prevent that wrong defined
    coordinates are taken over. That caused sometimes a crash.
    
  * Welt2000 update check added.
    
  * Free disk space method fixed, it delivered wrong results.

kflog (4.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added rfcomm0 to the list of selectable devices in the recorder dialog.
    This is the standard bluetooth device on most Linux systems.

  * Modifications in waypoint tree view widget. A catalog import was only
    possible in KFLog format. I changed that to all supported waypoint formats.
    The menu item "Import from File" has been removed. The contained Volkslogger
    menu entry has been added to the "Open Catalog" and to the "Import Catalog"
    menu items. I hope that gives the user more fexibility in the catalog handling.

  * Map and GUI icons added as resources to the KFLog binary. The Qt Resource
    system is used for that purpose.

kflog (4.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also can be handled
    runway length values using unit feet. That is not conform to the SeeYou
    specification but I saw that in a south African SeeYou waypoint file.
    
  * Map item Highway renamed to Motorway according to OSM usage.

  * Export routine added to write SeeYou waypoint files with extension .cup.

kflog (4.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New menu item added to map menu for asking of airspaces.
  
  * City labels are drawn now at the map till scale level less than 100. I saw
    at a first look that not all city labels are the right ones. The issue
    lays in the map data.

  * Bugfix: The coordinates of the map cursor were only displayed in the main
    window's statusbar, if a flight was loaded. That annoyed me. I fixed that.

  * Bugfix: If you touch a drawn flight line with the mouse, the data of the
    touched flight point is displayed in the lower statusbar of the main window.
    But the displayed coordinates were wrong. The latitude and longitude values
    were skewed.
    
  * If the begin or end cursor is moved in the evaluation window, the related
    flight point is now displayed with all its data in the main window's
    statusbar. I want to get the coordinates for a certain position in the
    barogram of the evaluation window but without my patch it was not possible.

kflog (4.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Two new spin boxes added to evaluation view for scaling of speed and
    variometer display by hand or automatically.

  * Drawing scale of evaluation data dynamically adapted to used smooth
    values. That ensures that all available place is used for the drawing.

  * Minimum scale for zooming in changed from 10 to 5.
  
  * Bugfix: Spelling bug fixed in configuration items /Scale/LowerLimit and
    /Scale/UpperLimit.
  
  * Bugfix: Maximum scale value for zoom out via mouse wheel was to large.
    That caused senseless map loading of the whole world.
    
  * IGC file name added to window title of evaluation view and to flight data
    window content.

  * BUGFIX: Method writeFilserDA4 file crashes with a core dump, if waypoint
    number is greater than 600. Fixed now.
    
  * BUGFIX: Waypoint import failed for Seeyou cup data file, if elevation unit
    was given in feet. Fixed now.
    
  * BUGFIX: Problems fixed in coordinate editor. There was no longitude degree
    input possible for values between 80-99 degrees.

kflog (4.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * USB problems fixed

    country identifiers because the whole file contains over 57282 entries. 
  * Airspace file management added to kflog settings.
  * Different minor bug fixes.
