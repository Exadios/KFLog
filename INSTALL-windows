A Basic Test Installation
=========================

Preconditions for self compiling KFlog4 under Ubuntu 11.10:

  1. Install QT SDK 4.8.0 (select mingw 32bit as compiler)

The simplest way to compile this package in Windows 7 is:

  1. 'cd' into the directory containing the package's source code and double click KFlog4Windows.pro

  2. Select the build configuration to be built, e.g. MinGW - QT 4.8.0 for Desktop - MinGW (Qt SDK) Release

  3. Hit compile and wait until you're done :)
     
You can checkout the latest sources by using subversion. Use the following
command to do that:

  svn co https://svn.kflog.org/svn/repos/kflog2/qt4/trunk
