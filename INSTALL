Basic Test Installation
=======================

The simplest way to compile this package is in Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx):

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make -f Makefile.qmake all'

  2. Type `make -f Makefile.qmake install_test' to install the programs and
     data files. The program can be found in the subdirectory release/bin.
     The data files are stored in your home directory and can be accessed
     by typing `cd ~/KFLog/'.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make -f Makefile.qmake clean'.
