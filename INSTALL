=========================
A Basic Test Installation
=========================

Preconditions for self compiling KFlog4 under Ubuntu 13.04:

  1. It should be installed the following Qt 4.8.x packages:
  
  qt4-dev-tools, qt4-qmake, libqt4-dev, libqt4-network, libqt4-xml,
  libqtcore4, libqtgui4
  
  If some packages are missing, install them with the following command:
  
  sudo apt-get install <package-name> ...

The simplest way to compile this package in Ubuntu 13.04 is:

  1. 'cd' into the directory containing the package's source code and type
     'make -f Makefile.qmake all'

  2. Type 'make -f Makefile.qmake install_test' to install the application and
     data files. The program can be found in the subdirectory release/bin.
     It carry the name kflog. All data files are stored in your home
     directory and can be accessed by typing 'cd ~/KFLog/'. The map files are
     stored in different subdirectories under the subdirectory mapdata.
     Landscape and airfield files are downloaded automatically. Airspace
     files have to be installed by hand.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing 'make -f Makefile.qmake distclean'.
     
You can use the following command to get the sources of KFLog as git repository.

  git clone https://github.com/kflog-project/KFLog.git
