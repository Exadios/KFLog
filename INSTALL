Basic Test Installation
=======================

Preconditions for compiling KFlog4 under Ubuntu 10.10:

  1. It should be installed the following Qt 4.7.x packages:
  
  qt4-dev-tools, qt4-qmake, libqt4-dev, libqt4-network, libqt4-qt3support,
  libqt4-xml, libqtcore4, libqtgui4

The simplest way to compile this package is in Ubuntu 10.10:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make -f Makefile.qmake all'

  2. Type `make -f Makefile.qmake install_test' to install the programs and
     data files. The program can be found in the subdirectory release/bin.
     The personal data files are stored in your home directory and can be
     accessed by typing `cd ~/KFLog/'.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make -f Makefile.qmake clean'.
