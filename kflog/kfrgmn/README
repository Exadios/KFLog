libkfrgmn:

The files in this directory are used for the recorder-backend for
Garmin GPSes. The lib is called "libkfrgmn" ("kfr" indicates,
that it is a kde-lib for accessing flight-recorders and "gmn" is an 
appreviation of Garmin).

The lib will be installed in $KDE_LIB. The file "gmn.desktop" will
be installed in $KDE_DATA/kflog/logger/ and is used to indicate, that
the lib is installed. It will be searched by KFLog each time the
recorder-dialog is opened.

The files in this directory are based on the work of Garmin 
Inc. (http://www.garmin.com/).

We want to thank Garmin for supplying the necessary documentation 
for us to implement the backend!
