dataport_300_sv517_rev22.txt is the text version of the original
Cambridge's "Data Port User's Guide SV-517 Revision 2.2" which can be
found here:
http://cambridge-aero.com/manuals/dataport_300_sv517_rev21.pdf

It has a number of errors, so dataport_300_sv517_rev23.txt is a
corrected version (well, there are still several open questions)
which was sent to Gary Kammerer at Cambridge.

Any new changes should get a new file name!
