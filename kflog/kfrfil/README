libkfrfil:

The files in this directory are used for the recorder-backend for
Filser recorders. The lib is called "libkfrfil" ("kfr" indicates,
that it is a kde-lib for accessing flight-recorders and "fil" is the
appreviation of Filser as it is used in the igc-files).

The lib will be installed in $KDE_LIB. The file "fil.desktop" will
be installed in $KDE_DATA/kflog/logger/ and is used to indicate, that
the lib is installed. It will be searched by KFLog each time the
recorder-dialog is opened.

The files in this directory are based on the work of 
Christian Fughe (wwwocf@kajo.home, C.M.Fughe@wtb.tue.nl) .
