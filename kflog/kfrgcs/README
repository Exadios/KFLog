libkfrgcs:

The files in this directory are used for the recorder-backend for
Volkslogger recorders. The lib is called "libkfrgcs" ("kfr" indicates,
that it is a kde-lib for accessing flight-recorders and "gcs" is the
appreviation of Garrecht Ingenieurgesellschaft as it is used in the
igc-files).

The lib will be installed in $KDE_LIB. The file "gcs.desktop" will
be installed in $KDE_DATA/kflog/logger/ and is used to indicate, that
the lib is installed. It will be searched by KFLog each time the
recorder-dialog is opened.

The files in this directory are based on the work of Garrecht
Ingenieurgesellschaft (http://www.volkslogger.de/).

We want to thank Garrecht for supporting us in implementing the
backend!
