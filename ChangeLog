  * Bugfix in mapcalc.cpp: the time is now always shown in UTC,
    regardless of the timezone
  * Bugfix in flight.cpp: the first and last flightstage are now
    shown in the evaluation dialog
  * GUI improvement in handling flightgroups

2009-03-22 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

    will have the elevation index stored in the "sort" field (which
    we didn't use previously).

2009-03-17 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * If KFLog was closed in another mode than map view (i.e. viewing
    the waypoint list or the evaluation window) it started downloading
    lots of map files after the next startup. This is fixed now.

  * Added tooltips for the waypoints.


2001-12-14 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

    will only change if the lower limit is larger or the upper limit
    is smaler as the current scale.


2001-12-09 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Reduced the number of pixmaps used for drawing. "allSites", "airports"
    and "glider" are drawn into the same pixmap now.

  * Now, the position and size of the dockwidgets will be saved and
    restored, so that the user will get the same window-layout again
    the next time he starts KFLog.


2001-12-07 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added all airspace-types to kflogconfig.

  * Reactivated printing. By now, all elements are printed the same way as
    displayed on the screen. We should add a seperate way to configure the
    printing.


2001-12-06 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added more airspaces to the config-dialog. The default-values
    for pens and brushes need to be fixed.


2001-12-04 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Changed the meaning of the configdata for cities. From now on,
    "Color [1234]" is used for the outline, not for filling. Filling
    is configured by "Brush Color [1234]". Therfore, we must look at the
    version of the configfile. Due to the way, cities are drawn, one can
    not set brushstyle or penstyle.

  * Changed the way, cities will be drawn into the map. Now a city
    is drawn only one time without having mistakes even when the city
    lies at the edge of a map-section.


2001-12-02 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Extended configuration-dialog and added widgets for configure penstyle
    and brushes.
