  * Added Map::slotCenterToWaypoint(). When the user selects a waypoint
    in the dataview, the map is centered to the selected waypoint and
    zoomed to the lower scale-limit.


2001-12-15 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added tooltips for the waypoints.


2001-12-14 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added reloading the mapscale after configuring KFLog. Also fixed
    a minor bug in MapMatrix::initMatrix(), so that the current scale
    will only change if the lower limit is larger or the upper limit
    is smaler as the current scale.


2001-12-09 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Reduced the number of pixmaps used for drawing. "allSites", "airports"
    and "glider" are drawn into the same pixmap now.

  * Now, the position and size of the dockwidgets will be saved and
    restored, so that the user will get the same window-layout again
    the next time he starts KFLog.


2001-12-07 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added all airspace-types to kflogconfig.

  * Reactivated printing. By now, all elements are printed the same way as
    displayed on the screen. We should add a seperate way to configure the
    printing.


2001-12-06 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added more airspaces to the config-dialog. The default-values
    for pens and brushes need to be fixed.


2001-12-04 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Changed the meaning of the configdata for cities. From now on,
    "Color [1234]" is used for the outline, not for filling. Filling
    is configured by "Brush Color [1234]". Therfore, we must look at the
    version of the configfile. Due to the way, cities are drawn, one can
    not set brushstyle or penstyle.

  * Changed the way, cities will be drawn into the map. Now a city
    is drawn only one time without having mistakes even when the city
    lies at the edge of a map-section.


2001-12-02 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Extended configuration-dialog and added widgets for configure penstyle
    and brushes.


2001-12-02 Florian <florian@kflog.org>

  * Extended the evaluation-dialog. Added two splitters to allow the
    user to change the size of the text below the graph.

  * Added the waypoints to the evaluation-graph.


2001-12-01 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Fixed a bug in map.cpp, that could crash the X-Server.


2001-11-27 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added MapConfig as central configuration-object.


2001-11-25 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added recognition of point-validation. Now the validation-flag of the
    logger will be read. Non-valid points will be ignored in calculation
    distance and speed.

  * Fixed some bugs in parsing an igc-file. Now a negative height will be
    read without generating an syntax-error.


2001-11-18 Göran Källqvist <kjellqvist@nordkalak.se>

  * Added swedish translation


2001-11-17 Thomas Nielsen <thomanie@stud.ntnu.no>
