  * Added more airspaces to the config-dialog. The default-values
    for pens and brushes need to be fixed.


2001-12-04 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Changed the meaning of the configdata for cities. From now on,
    "Color [1234]" is used for the outline, not for filling. Filling
    is configured by "Brush Color [1234]". Therfore, we must look at the
    version of the configfile. Due to the way, cities are drawn, one can
    not set brushstyle or penstyle.

  * Changed the way, cities will be drawn into the map. Now a city
    is drawn only one time without having mistakes even when the city
    lies at the edge of a map-section.


2001-12-02 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Extended configuration-dialog and added widgets for configure penstyle
    and brushes.


2001-12-02 Florian <florian@kflog.org>

  * Extended the evaluation-dialog. Adden two splitters to allow the
    user to change the size of the text below the graph.

  * Added the waypoints to the evaluation-graph.


2001-11-25 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added recognition of point-validation. Now the validation-flag of the
    logger will be read. Non-valid points will be ignored in calculation
    distance and speed.

  * Fixed some bugs in parsing an igc-file. Now a negative height will be
    read without generating an syntax-error.
